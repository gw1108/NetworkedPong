NetworkedPong
=============

This is a TCP implemented pong game that is configured from the command line. It is a WIP and is lacking polish atm. The server has the ability to simulate latency for testing on a local host.

The project was initially a school project for learning networking code. I am going to be updating it so that is becomes a fully working and complete game.
